            <h1>Let Me Break Down Loan Disbursement For You</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">by Marcus, Howard University '25 | Financial Aid Peer Advisor</p>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <p><em>Real talk: My freshman year, I thought my loan money would hit my account the first day of classes. It didn't. I couldn't buy books for two weeks. That stress? I don't want you to go through it. So let me break this down.</em></p>

            <h2>What Is Disbursement? (In Plain English)</h2>
            <p>Disbursement is when your loan money actually gets sent to your school. Not when you sign the paperwork. Not when you accept the loan. When the money <strong>actually moves</strong>.</p>

            <p>Here's what nobody tells you upfront: <strong>You never get all your loan money at once</strong>. Ever.</p>

            <p>I learned this the hard way. You don't have to.</p>

            <h2>Why It Comes in Stages</h2>
            <p>Federal loans are split up throughout the year. It's not random—it's tied to your enrollment. Think of it like this: the government wants to make sure you're actually in school before sending more money.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>The Basic Rule (This Is Important)</h3>
                <p>If your loan covers a full academic year (fall and spring), here's how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Half comes at the start of fall semester</li>
                    <li>Half comes at the start of spring semester</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>That's it. That's the rule.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Let Me Show You Some Examples</h2>

            <h3>Full-Year Loans (Most of Y'all)</h3>
            <p>Say you borrowed $10,000 for the academic year. Here's what happens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$5,000 shows up in August/September (fall semester)</li>
                <li>$5,000 shows up in January (spring semester)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can't get it all in August. You can't ask for it early. That's just how it works.</p>

            <h3>Single-Semester Loans</h3>
            <p>If you only borrowed for one semester, you get one disbursement at the start of that semester. Simple.</p>

            <h3>Summer Loans (This Gets Confusing)</h3>
            <p>Summer is weird. Some schools treat it as part of the previous year, some treat it as part of the next year. Check with your financial aid office because every school does this differently.</p>

            <h2>First-Time Borrowers: Listen Up</h2>
            <p>If this is your FIRST federal student loan ever, there's a delay. Here's what you need to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your first disbursement can't happen until <strong>30 days after your first day of classes</strong></li>
                <li>This is a federal rule. Your school can't change it.</li>
                <li>It only happens your first time borrowing—not every year</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>Why This Matters (Trust Me)</h3>
                <p>If you're counting on that loan money to buy books, pay a housing deposit, or cover your first month's expenses, you're going to have a gap. That's 30 days you need to figure out.</p>
                <p>This is exactly what happened to me freshman year. I had to borrow money from my RA to buy my biology textbook. Not fun.</p>
                <p><strong>Plan ahead. Ask family, look for emergency loans from your school, or see if you can work extra hours before school starts.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>What You Can't Control</h2>
            <p>I get asked this all the time: "Can I just get all my money upfront?"</p>
            <p>No. You can't.</p>

            <p>The disbursement schedule is set by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Federal regulations (the government makes the rules)</li>
                <li>Your school's academic calendar (when semesters start)</li>
                <li>Your enrollment status (full-time vs part-time)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can't speed it up. You can't change it. What you CAN do is understand it and plan around it.</p>

            <h2>What You Should Do Next</h2>
            <p>Now that you know what disbursement is, you need to understand <a href="timing.html">exactly when your money will show up</a> and what can delay it. That's the next piece.</p>

            <p>You got this. I'm here to help.</p>
