        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>What Is Disbursement?</h2>
            <p>Disbursement is when your loan money is actually sent to your school. It's not when you sign the paperwork—it's when the cash moves.</p>
            <p>Here's what most students don't realize: <strong>you never get all your loan money at once</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Why It Happens in Stages</h2>
            <p>Federal student loans are disbursed in multiple payments throughout the academic year. This isn't arbitrary—it's designed to match your enrollment.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <h3>The Basic Rule</h3>
                <p>If your loan covers a full academic year (fall and spring), you'll get:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Half at the start of fall semester</li>
                    <li>Half at the start of spring semester</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Common Disbursement Schedules</h2>
            
            <h3>Full-Year Loans (Most Common)</h3>
            <p>If you borrowed $10,000 for the academic year:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$5,000 disbursed in August/September</li>
                <li>$5,000 disbursed in January</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Single-Semester Loans</h3>
            <p>If you only borrowed for one semester, you'll get one disbursement at the start of that semester.</p>

            <h3>Summer Loans</h3>
            <p>Summer is treated as a "trailer" to the previous academic year or a "header" to the next one, depending on your school's policy.</p>

            <h2>First-Time Borrower Delays</h2>
            <p>If this is your first federal student loan, there's an additional waiting period:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your first disbursement can't happen until <strong>30 days after the first day of your enrollment period</strong></li>
                <li>This is a federal requirement to give you time to reconsider</li>
                <li>It only applies to your very first loan—not every year</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>If you're counting on loan money to pay for books, housing deposits, or other upfront costs in your first few weeks, you might have a gap. Plan accordingly.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What You Don't Get to Control</h2>
            <p>You can't ask for all your money upfront. You can't change the disbursement schedule. The timing is set by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Federal regulations</li>
                <li>Your school's academic calendar</li>
                <li>Your enrollment status</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Now that you understand <em>what</em> disbursement is, learn about <a href="timing.html">how the timing actually works</a> and what can delay your money.</p>
