                <p><strong>Hey, it's Marcus.</strong> Howard University senior, financial aid peer advisor, first-gen student from Atlanta. I help students navigate this stuff every day. Here are the questions I get asked all the time.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Questions Students Ask Me All The Time</h2>
            <p>I work as a financial aid peer advisor at Howard. These are the questions I get asked every single day. Let me answer them for you.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When will my student loan money actually show up?</h3>
                <p>For most students, your loan disburses within <strong>10 days before or after classes start</strong>. Your school picks the exact date.</p>
                <p>But if this is your FIRST federal loan ever, add 30 days to that. So if classes start August 20, you're looking at late September.</p>
                <p>Check your student portal for the exact date. Don't guess—know.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why is there a hold on my disbursement?</h3>
                <p>Okay, so this happens a lot. Here are the usual suspects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Entrance counseling not done</strong> – Takes 30 minutes online, do it now</li>
                    <li><strong>Master Promissory Note (MPN) not signed</strong> – This is the legal contract, you have to sign it</li>
                    <li><strong>Enrollment issues</strong> – You might not be enrolled in enough credits (need at least 6 for half-time)</li>
                    <li><strong>Missing documents</strong> – Check your financial aid to-do list</li>
                    <li><strong>First-time borrower delay</strong> – That 30-day wait I keep mentioning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Go to your student portal right now and check for holds. Clear them today, not tomorrow.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I get all my loan money at once?</h3>
                <p>No. Never.</p>
                <p>If you borrowed for the full year, you get half in fall and half in spring. That's how it works for everyone.</p>
                <p>You can't change this. You can't ask for it all upfront. It's federal law.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's this 30-day delay everyone keeps talking about?</h3>
                <p>If you've never taken out a federal student loan before, the government makes you wait 30 days after classes start before your first disbursement.</p>
                <p>They say it's to give you time to reconsider. In reality, it means first-gen students like me are scrambling to cover costs for a month.</p>
                <p>This only happens once—your very first loan. After that, you're on the normal schedule.</p>
                <p>Plan for this gap. Ask family, look for emergency loans from your school, work extra hours before school starts. Don't get caught off guard like I did.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Where does my loan money go when it's disbursed?</h3>
                <p>It goes to your school first. Not to you.</p>
                <p>Your school uses it to pay (in this order):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tuition</li>
                    <li>Mandatory fees</li>
                    <li>On-campus housing and meal plan (if you have them)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Whatever's left over comes to you as a refund. That's when you can use it for books, rent, food, etc.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long until I get my refund?</h3>
                <p>After your loan disburses to your school, they have up to <strong>14 days</strong> to send you the refund.</p>
                <p>If you set up direct deposit, it'll hit your account 2-3 business days after they process it.</p>
                <p>If you're waiting for a paper check, add another week for mail time.</p>
                <p>Set up direct deposit if you haven't already. It's way faster.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I cancel my loan after it's been disbursed?</h3>
                <p>Yes! You have <strong>120 days</strong> from disbursement to return all or part of your loan without paying any interest.</p>
                <p>Contact your financial aid office and tell them you want to return it. They'll process it.</p>
                <p>This is smart if you got a refund and realize you don't actually need it. Don't keep loan money you don't need—you'll pay interest on it for years.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens if I drop classes?</h3>
                <p>If you drop below half-time (usually 6 credits) BEFORE your loan disburses, the disbursement gets canceled.</p>
                <p>If you drop AFTER it disburses, you might have to pay some or all of it back. And you'll enter your grace period, which starts the clock on repayment.</p>
                <p>Don't drop classes without talking to financial aid first. Seriously. The consequences are real.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>My disbursement date passed but I don't have my money. What do I do?</h3>
                <p>First, check your student portal for holds. Clear anything that's pending.</p>
                <p>Second, make sure you're enrolled in enough credits.</p>
                <p>Third, if everything looks good, call financial aid. Don't email—call. You need answers now, not in 3-5 business days.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I speed up my disbursement?</h3>
                <p>No. The timeline is set by federal law and your school's policies.</p>
                <p>What you CAN do is make sure you're not the reason for a delay:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete all paperwork as soon as it's available</li>
                    <li>Clear any holds immediately</li>
                    <li>Make sure you're enrolled in enough credits</li>
                    <li>Set up direct deposit for faster refunds</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
