            <h1>How Disbursement Timing Works</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">When your loan money actually arrives</p>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>The Standard Timeline</h2>
            <p>For most students, loan disbursement happens within the first few days of the semester. But "first few days" doesn't mean the first day of class.</p>

            <h3>Typical Disbursement Window</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10 days before</strong> to <strong>10 days after</strong> the start of the semester</li>
                <li>Your school sets the exact date within this window</li>
                <li>You can usually find this date in your student portal or financial aid office</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>First-Time Borrower Delays</h2>
            <p>If you've never taken out a federal student loan before, there's a mandatory waiting period.</p>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>The 30-Day Rule</h3>
                <p>Your first disbursement cannot happen until at least 30 days after your enrollment period begins.</p>
                <p>This means if classes start August 20, your first disbursement can't happen before September 19.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why This Exists</h3>
            <p>The federal government requires this delay to give first-time borrowers a chance to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reconsider whether they need the loan</li>
                <li>Reduce the loan amount if they find other funding</li>
                <li>Cancel the loan entirely without penalty</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Does It Apply Every Year?</h3>
            <p><strong>No.</strong> This only applies to your very first federal student loan. Once you've had one disbursement, future loans follow the standard timeline.</p>

            <h2>School Holds and Clearance Requirements</h2>
            <p>Even if your loan is approved and scheduled, your school can delay disbursement if you haven't met certain requirements.</p>

            <h3>Common Holds</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entrance counseling not completed</strong> – Required for first-time borrowers</li>
                <li><strong>Master Promissory Note (MPN) not signed</strong> – The legal agreement for your loan</li>
                <li><strong>Enrollment verification</strong> – You must be enrolled at least half-time</li>
                <li><strong>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)</strong> – You must meet your school's academic standards</li>
                <li><strong>Outstanding balances</strong> – Some schools hold disbursements if you owe money from previous semesters</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>How to Check for Holds</h3>
                <p>Log into your student portal and look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial aid checklist</li>
                    <li>Account holds or blocks</li>
                    <li>To-do items</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you see anything pending, complete it immediately. These holds can delay your disbursement by weeks.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Semester-by-Semester Timing</h2>
            
            <h3>Fall Semester</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically disbursed late August or early September</li>
                <li>First-time borrowers: late September or early October</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spring Semester</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically disbursed early to mid-January</li>
                <li>No 30-day delay (unless it's your very first loan ever)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summer Semester</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Timing varies widely by school</li>
                <li>Some schools treat summer as part of the previous academic year</li>
                <li>Others treat it as part of the upcoming year</li>
                <li>Check with your financial aid office for your school's policy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Happens If You Drop Classes?</h2>
            <p>If you drop below half-time enrollment before your loan disburses, the disbursement will be canceled.</p>
            <p>If you drop after disbursement, you may have to return some or all of the money, depending on when you withdrew.</p>

            <h2>Can You Speed It Up?</h2>
            <p><strong>No.</strong> You cannot request early disbursement. The timeline is set by federal regulations and your school's policies.</p>
            <p>What you <em>can</em> do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete all required paperwork early</li>
                <li>Clear any holds on your account</li>
                <li>Confirm your enrollment status</li>
            </ul>
