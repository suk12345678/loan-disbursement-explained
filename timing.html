        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Hey, it's Marcus.</strong> Howard University senior, financial aid peer advisor, first-gen student from Atlanta. I help students navigate this stuff every day. Let me break down the timing so you can actually plan.</p>
            </div>

            <p><em>Alright, so you know your loan is coming in stages. Now let's talk about WHEN it actually hits your account. Because "beginning of the semester" is vague, and vague doesn't help you plan.</em></p>

            <h2>The Standard Timeline (For Most Students)</h2>
            <p>Here's what "beginning of the semester" actually means:</p>

            <h3>The Disbursement Window</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10 days before</strong> to <strong>10 days after</strong> the first day of classes</li>
                <li>Your school picks the exact date in that window</li>
                <li>Check your student portal or call financial aid to find out the specific date</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So if classes start August 20, your money could show up anywhere from August 10 to August 30. That's a big range if you're trying to budget.</p>

            <h2>First-Time Borrowers: This Is Different For You</h2>
            <p>If you've never taken out a federal student loan before, listen up. There's a delay.</p>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>The 30-Day Rule (This Caught Me Off Guard)</h3>
                <p>Your first disbursement can't happen until <strong>at least 30 days after your first day of classes</strong>.</p>
                <p>Let me say that again: If classes start August 20, your money won't come until September 19 at the earliest.</p>
                <p>That's a month. A whole month where you need books, supplies, maybe rent. And your loan money isn't there yet.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why Does This Exist?</h3>
            <p>The government says it's to give you time to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reconsider if you really need the loan</li>
                <li>Reduce the amount if you find other money</li>
                <li>Cancel it without penalty</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's the official reason. The real impact? First-gen students like me scrambling to cover costs for a month.</p>

            <h3>Does This Happen Every Year?</h3>
            <p><strong>No.</strong> Only your very first federal loan ever. After that first disbursement, you're on the normal schedule.</p>

            <p>So if you're a freshman reading this: plan for that gap. If you're a sophomore or beyond: you're good.</p>

            <h2>Things That Can Delay Your Money</h2>
            <p>Even if your loan is approved, your school can hold it if you haven't done certain things. I see this happen all the time.</p>

            <h3>Common Holds (Check For These NOW)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entrance counseling not done</strong> – It's online, takes 30 minutes, do it early</li>
                <li><strong>Master Promissory Note (MPN) not signed</strong> – This is the legal contract for your loan</li>
                <li><strong>Not enrolled at least half-time</strong> – You need to be taking enough credits</li>
                <li><strong>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) issue</strong> – If your GPA is too low or you're not completing enough classes</li>
                <li><strong>You owe money from last semester</strong> – Some schools won't release new aid until you clear old balances</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>How to Check For Holds</h3>
                <p>Go to your student portal right now and look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial aid checklist</li>
                    <li>Account holds or blocks</li>
                    <li>To-do items</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you see ANYTHING pending, handle it today. Not tomorrow. Today.</p>
                <p>I've seen holds delay disbursements by weeks. Don't let that be you.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Semester-by-Semester Breakdown</h2>

            <h3>Fall Semester</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Most students: late August or early September</li>
                <li>First-time borrowers: late September or early October</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spring Semester</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Most students: early to mid-January</li>
                <li>No 30-day delay (unless this is literally your first loan ever)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summer Semester</h3>
            <p>Summer is all over the place. Some schools count it as part of the previous year, some count it as part of the next year. You need to ask your financial aid office because there's no standard answer.</p>

            <h2>What If You Drop Classes?</h2>
            <p>Here's what happens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Before disbursement:</strong> If you drop below half-time, your loan gets canceled</li>
                <li><strong>After disbursement:</strong> You might have to pay some or all of it back, depending on when you withdrew</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Don't drop classes without talking to financial aid first. Seriously.</p>

            <h2>Can You Get It Faster?</h2>
            <p>Short answer: No.</p>

            <p>You can't request early disbursement. The timeline is federal law plus your school's policies. It is what it is.</p>

            <p>What you CAN do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete all paperwork as soon as it's available (like, the day it opens)</li>
                <li>Clear any holds on your account immediately</li>
                <li>Make sure you're enrolled in enough credits</li>
                <li>Stay on top of your email—financial aid will send you reminders</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can't speed up the system, but you can make sure you're not the reason for a delay.</p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>Now you know when your money shows up. Next, you need to understand <a href="where-it-goes.html">where it actually goes</a> when it gets disbursed. Because it doesn't just land in your bank account.</p>

            <p>Let me walk you through that next.</p>
