        <h1>when your loan money actually shows up</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">let me break this down so you don't panic like I did freshman year</p>

        <div class="story-box">
            <p><strong>Real talk from Marcus:</strong> August 2020. I'm a freshman at Howard, sitting in my dorm with $8 in my bank account. Classes start in 3 days. I need textbooks that cost $400. My financial aid says "awarded" but the money? Nowhere. I'm calling my mom panicking, she's panicking, we both thought I did something wrong.</p>
            <p>Turns out? The money was coming. I just didn't understand the timeline. That week of stress could have been avoided if someone had just explained how disbursement actually works.</p>
            <p>Now I'm a senior and I work as a financial aid peer advisor. I've helped hundreds of students through this. Let me break it down for you.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>here's what you need to know about timing</h2>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>The Basic Timeline</h3>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Your school's financial aid office processes your loans (usually 1-2 weeks before classes start)</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Money goes to your school account FIRST to cover tuition and fees</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Whatever's left over (the "refund") gets sent to you</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> That refund takes 3-5 business days to hit your bank account</p>
        </div>

        <p>So if classes start August 25th, you might not see your refund money until September 5th or later. That's <span class="highlight">two weeks of living expenses you need to cover yourself.</span></p>

        <h2>what I learned the hard way</h2>

        <h3>Don't count on day-one money</h3>
        <p>I thought my refund would be there the first day of class. Wrong. Even if your school is fast, you're looking at the second week of classes minimum. Plan accordingly.</p>

        <h3>The bookstore knows this</h3>
        <p>Most campus bookstores let you charge books to your student account if you have financial aid coming. They know students are waiting on disbursement. Ask about it - saved my life freshman year once I figured it out.</p>

        <h3>Direct deposit is your friend</h3>
        <p>Set this up BEFORE the semester starts. Paper checks add another week of waiting. I'm serious - do this in July, not August.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Watch out:</strong> Some schools hold your refund if you have any holds on your account. Parking tickets, library fines, missing immunization records - anything can delay your money. Check your account for holds in the summer.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>questions I get all the time</h2>

        <h3>"Why does the school get the money first?"</h3>
        <p>Because they're the ones who certified you're enrolled and eligible. They take what you owe them (tuition, fees, housing if you're on campus), then send you the rest. It's not them being greedy - it's how the system works.</p>

        <h3>"What if I need money before disbursement?"</h3>
        <p>Here's what I tell students:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save what you can over the summer (I know it's hard, but even $200 helps)</li>
            <li>Look into emergency loans from your school - many have them for this exact situation</li>
            <li>Check if your school has a food pantry for those first weeks</li>
            <li>Talk to your financial aid office about advance disbursement if you have a real emergency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"Can I speed this up?"</h3>
        <p>Not really. But you can make sure you're not slowing it down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete your entrance counseling and master promissory note EARLY (like June/July)</li>
            <li>Make sure your school has your current address and banking info</li>
            <li>Respond immediately if financial aid emails you asking for anything</li>
            <li>Clear any holds on your account before the semester starts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>my advice as someone who's been there</h2>

        <p>Look, I know this system is frustrating. You're approved for money you need, but you can't access it when you need it most. I get it. I've been there, stressed out, trying to figure out how to eat until the refund comes.</p>

        <p>But here's the thing - <span class="highlight">knowing the timeline takes away the panic.</span> When you know your refund isn't coming until September 8th, you can plan. You can save a little extra over summer. You can set up that emergency loan. You can talk to your family about covering groceries for two weeks.</p>

        <p>The stress I had freshman year came from not knowing. I thought I did something wrong. I thought my aid was cancelled. I thought I was going to have to drop out.</p>

        <p>None of that was true. The money was coming. I just needed to understand when.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Your loan money will come. It just takes time to process. Plan for 2-3 weeks after classes start before you see your refund. Set up direct deposit. Clear any account holds. And breathe - you got this.</p>
