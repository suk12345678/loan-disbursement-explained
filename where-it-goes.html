            <h1>Where Your Money Actually Goes</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Spoiler: It doesn't go straight to you</p>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <p><em>Okay, so your loan got disbursed. Where is it? Why isn't it in your bank account? Let me break down exactly what happens to that money.</em></p>

            <h2>The Money Goes to Your School First</h2>
            <p>Here's what a lot of students don't realize: when your loan is disbursed, it doesn't come to you. It goes straight to your school.</p>

            <p>Your school then uses it to pay your charges in a specific order. This order is federal law—your school can't change it.</p>

            <h2>The Payment Order (This Is Important)</h2>
            <p>Your loan money gets applied like this:</p>

            <h3>1. Tuition and Fees Come First</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuition for the semester</li>
                <li>Mandatory fees (technology fee, health fee, activity fee, all that)</li>
                <li>This happens automatically—you don't have to do anything</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. School-Billed Charges Come Second</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On-campus housing (if you live in dorms)</li>
                <li>Meal plan (if you have one)</li>
                <li>Any other services the school provides that you signed up for</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. You Get What's Left (The Refund)</h3>
            <p>If there's money left over after paying your school charges, you get a refund.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Real Talk About Refunds</h3>
                <p>That refund is NOT free money. It's not a bonus. It's loan money you borrowed, and you're going to pay it back with interest.</p>
                <p>Use it for actual education expenses: books, supplies, rent (if you live off-campus), transportation, food.</p>
                <p>Don't blow it on stuff you don't need. I've seen people do that, and they regret it when they're paying it back years later.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How Refunds Actually Work</h2>

            <h3>When You Get It</h3>
            <p>Schools have to issue refunds within <strong>14 days</strong> of disbursement or the first day of classes (whichever is later).</p>
            <p>So if your loan disburses August 15 and classes start August 20, you should get your refund by September 3 at the latest.</p>

            <h3>How You Get It</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct deposit</strong> – This is the fastest (2-3 business days after they process it)</li>
                <li><strong>Paper check</strong> – This is slower (7-10 business days, plus mail time)</li>
                <li><strong>School debit card</strong> – Some schools offer this</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you haven't set up direct deposit yet, do it now. Go to your student portal and add your bank account info. It'll save you a week of waiting.</p>

            <h2>What If You Borrowed Too Much?</h2>
            <p>Let's say you get your refund and realize you don't actually need all of it. Good news: you can return it.</p>

            <p>If you return loan money within <strong>120 days of disbursement</strong>, you won't pay any interest on it. It's like you never borrowed it.</p>

            <h3>How to Return Money</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Contact your financial aid office (call or email)</li>
                <li>Tell them you want to return part or all of your loan</li>
                <li>They'll process it and notify your loan servicer</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is smart if you got a refund and realize you don't need it for school expenses. Don't keep loan money you don't need—you'll pay interest on it for years.</p>

            <h2>How to Track Your Disbursement</h2>

            <h3>Check Your Student Portal</h3>
            <p>Your school's portal will show you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When your loan is expected to disburse</li>
                <li>How much is coming</li>
                <li>How it was applied to your account</li>
                <li>If you're getting a refund and how much</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Check this regularly. It's the most up-to-date info you'll get.</p>

            <h3>Check StudentAid.gov</h3>
            <p>Go to <a href="https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing" target="_blank">StudentAid.gov</a> and log in. You can see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All your federal loans</li>
                <li>Disbursement history</li>
                <li>Current balances</li>
                <li>Who your loan servicer is</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is the official federal database. If it's not showing up here yet, it might not be fully processed.</p>

            <h3>Check With Your Loan Servicer</h3>
            <p>Your loan servicer (the company that manages your loan) will send you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Disbursement notices</li>
                <li>Monthly statements</li>
                <li>Balance updates</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Create an account on their website so you can check anytime.</p>

            <h2>Common Problems (And How to Fix Them)</h2>

            <h3>My Disbursement Didn't Happen</h3>
            <p>First, check for holds in your student portal. Look for any blocks or to-do items.</p>
            <p>Second, make sure you're enrolled at least half-time (usually 6 credits).</p>
            <p>If everything looks good and it still didn't disburse, call financial aid. Don't email—call. You need answers fast.</p>

            <h3>My Refund Is Less Than I Expected</h3>
            <p>Check your account charges. Your school might have added fees you didn't know about.</p>
            <p>Also check if you have any outstanding balances from previous semesters. Some schools will use your current loan to pay old debt.</p>

            <h3>My Refund Hasn't Shown Up</h3>
            <p>Remember, schools have 14 days. Count from your disbursement date, not from the first day of classes.</p>
            <p>Check your direct deposit info in the portal. If it's wrong, your refund is sitting in limbo.</p>
            <p>If it's been more than 14 days, call the bursar's office (not financial aid—bursar handles refunds).</p>
