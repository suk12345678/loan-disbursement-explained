        <section class="content">
            <h2>The Money Never Touches Your Hands First</h2>
            <p>When your loan is disbursed, it doesn't go to you. It goes directly to your school.</p>
            <p>Your school then applies it to your account in a specific order.</p>

            <h2>The Payment Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>Your school is required to use your loan money in this order:</p>

            <h3>1. Tuition and Fees (First Priority)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuition for the semester</li>
                <li>Mandatory fees (technology, health, activity, etc.)</li>
                <li>These are automatically deducted</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. School-Billed Charges (Second Priority)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On-campus housing</li>
                <li>Meal plans</li>
                <li>Other school-provided services you've signed up for</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Refund to You (What's Left Over)</h3>
            <p>If there's money remaining after covering your school charges, you get a refund.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Important</h3>
                <p>The refund is not "extra money." It's loan money you borrowed. You'll have to pay it back with interest.</p>
                <p>Use it for legitimate education expenses: books, supplies, off-campus rent, transportation, food.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How Refunds Work</h2>
            
            <h3>Timing</h3>
            <p>Schools must issue refunds within <strong>14 days</strong> of disbursement or the first day of classes, whichever is later.</p>

            <h3>Delivery Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct deposit</strong> – Fastest option (2-3 business days)</li>
                <li><strong>Paper check</strong> – Slower (7-10 business days)</li>
                <li><strong>School debit card</strong> – Some schools offer this option</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Set up direct deposit in your student portal if you haven't already. It's significantly faster.</p>

            <h2>What If You Borrowed Too Much?</h2>
            <p>If you realize you don't need the full loan amount, you can return all or part of it within <strong>120 days</strong> of disbursement without paying interest.</p>

            <h3>How to Return Loan Money</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Contact your school's financial aid office</li>
                <li>Tell them you want to return part or all of your loan</li>
                <li>They'll process the return and notify your loan servicer</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is especially useful if you got a refund and realize you don't need it for education expenses.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Your Disbursement</h2>
            
            <h3>In Your Student Portal</h3>
            <p>Your school's student portal will show:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expected disbursement dates</li>
                <li>Disbursement amounts</li>
                <li>How the money was applied to your account</li>
                <li>Refund status</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>On the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS)</h3>
            <p>Visit <a href="https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing" target="_blank">StudentAid.gov</a> to see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All your federal loans</li>
                <li>Disbursement history</li>
                <li>Current balances</li>
                <li>Loan servicer information</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>From Your Loan Servicer</h3>
            <p>Your loan servicer (the company that manages your loan) will send you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Disbursement notices</li>
                <li>Account statements</li>
                <li>Current balance updates</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Issues and How to Fix Them</h2>

            <h3>Disbursement Didn't Happen</h3>
            <p><strong>Check for holds:</strong> Log into your student portal and look for any blocks or to-do items.</p>
            <p><strong>Verify enrollment:</strong> Make sure you're enrolled at least half-time.</p>
            <p><strong>Contact financial aid:</strong> If everything looks clear, call your financial aid office.</p>

            <h3>Refund Is Less Than Expected</h3>
            <p><strong>Review your account charges:</strong> Your school may have added fees or charges you weren't expecting.</p>
            <p><strong>Check for outstanding balances:</strong> Some schools apply current disbursements to previous balances.</p>

            <h3>Refund Hasn't Arrived</h3>
            <p><strong>Check the 14-day window:</strong> Schools have up to 14 days to issue refunds.</p>
            <p><strong>Verify your direct deposit info:</strong> Wrong account info will delay your refund.</p>
            <p><strong>Contact the bursar's office:</strong> They handle refund processing.</p>
